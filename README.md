# Calculator Application Using Method Overloading

## 📝 Description

A calculator application demonstrating method overloading with support for different data types and operations.

## 📂 Files Included

- `Assignment2_Calculator.java`
- `Assignment2_UserInterface.java`

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command line or terminal access

### Compilation
```bash
# Compile all Java files
javac *.java
```

### Execution
```bash
# Run the main program
java UserInterface
```

## ✨ Features

- Add two integers
- Add two doubles
- Add three integers
- Subtract integers
- Multiply doubles
- Divide integers with zero-division handling

## 🎯 Concepts Demonstrated

- Method Overloading
- Polymorphism
- Exception Handling (ArithmeticException)
- Type Casting
- Menu-driven interface

## 📋 Usage Instructions

1. **Compile** all Java files using the compilation command above
2. **Run** the main class
3. **Follow** the on-screen menu to navigate through options
4. **Input** data as prompted by the program
5. The program includes **input validation** and **error handling**

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases

#### Valid Input Testing
- Add records with valid data
- Perform all menu operations
- Verify expected outputs

#### Invalid Input Testing
- Test with negative numbers
- Test with out-of-range values
- Test with empty inputs
- Verify error messages appear

#### Edge Cases
- Test with empty data structures
- Test with maximum capacity
- Test boundary conditions

## 📊 Sample Run

The program provides a **menu-driven interface** with clear prompts and error messages for invalid inputs.


## 🛡️ Error Handling

The program includes comprehensive error handling:
- Try-catch blocks for all user inputs
- Input validation with meaningful error messages
- Graceful handling of exceptions

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

After completing this assignment, you will understand:
- Method Overloading
- Polymorphism
- Exception Handling (ArithmeticException)
- Type Casting
- Menu-driven interface

## 👨‍💻 Code Quality

The code follows best practices:
- **Proper naming conventions** (CamelCase for classes, camelCase for variables)
- **Encapsulation** (private fields with public getters/setters)
- **Code documentation** with comments
- **Modular design** with separate classes for different responsibilities
- **Resource management** (proper closing of Scanner and file streams)

## 📖 Additional Notes

- All inputs are validated before processing
- The program handles edge cases gracefully
- User-friendly error messages guide the user
- Code is well-commented for readability
